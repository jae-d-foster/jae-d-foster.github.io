    <p style="font-family:'Arial';">As a future teacher, I believe that all students are capable of growth when they feel safe, respected, and meaningfully engaged. My classroom management philosophy is built around the belief that behaviour is a form of communication, and that creating a predictable, inclusive, and relational environment is absolutely essential for promoting both wellbeing and academic success. I see my role as a teacher, as not only an instructor but also a facilitator of positive peer relationships, a model of respectful interactions, and a dedicated support for diverse student needs.

      My approach is built around the incorporation of Positive Behaviour Support (PBS), Bill Rogers’ Eclectic Model of Decisive Discipline, and elements of Choice Theory. These frameworks work along side one another in promoting proactive, structured, and student-centred behaviour support. PBS provides a tiered model for promoting positive behaviour and responding to misbehaviour with consistency and equity, while Rogers’ model adds practical strategies for maintaining calm authority and respectful correction to behaviour. Choice Theory informs my focus on student agency, which helps learners understand the link between their choices and consequences in a supportive way. Together, these models support the development of safe, engaging classrooms that ultimately prioritise wellbeing, connection, and accountability.
